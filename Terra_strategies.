A) Blue-green Deployment:
====================================================
1. If we have some existing server then we create new servers and we will route traffic by using ELB from existing server to new servers.
2. If it will not work properly we need to 
3. Blue is old code and green is new code.
4. Blue/green deployment : versoin B is relesed alongside version A and then traffic is switched over to version B.

B) Rolling deployment strategies.
====================================================
1. If you some application server running then you will create some new version then you will remove old.
2. In that case your old code and new code will be capable of running at same time in parallel environment that old environment and then in new environment.

C) Canary Deployment
=====================================================
1. It will keep updating new server and delete old server.
2. it useful when two different codes need to run in new environment.
3. Canary : Version B is related to subgroups of users then proceed to full rollout.

D) Recreate Strategy  (IMP) 
=====================================================
1. We need to down all servers and we need to deploy new version then need to bring the services into running state.
2. We can also acheive this on another way we need to create separate infrastructure.
3. And you can migrate to new infra to minimize the downtime.
4. but in this we can run previous current and new code in same time.
5. Here we required some downtime.

E) A/B Deployment ----> It used for Testing purpose
=====================================================
1. This will work on loadbalencer if part A has old code and serving for server 1 the part B will server for new code.
2. A/B testing = version b is released to particular subset of user under specific condition.

F) Custom strategy 
=====================================================
1. It is deployment method where youe website or application is never down or in unstable state during deployment process.
2. To achieve this web server doesn't serving the changed code until the entire deployment process is complete.
